### TASK 

#### *What do we mean by coupling and cohesion when discussing structured design?*

Coupling describes the relationships between modules.
Cohesion describes the relationships within them.

#### *What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up design? Which best describes a function oriented design?*

The difference is that top-down design starts with the general concept and breaks it down into its section parts repeatedly. 
Function Oriented design is where the model is decomposed into a set of interacting parts where they have their own defined function.

#### *In which design methodology would a class diagram be most useful?*

Using a UML diagram platform where mapping out class diagrams will be helpful in condensing complications and allowing for a clearer way to see what the goal is.

#### *What are the four pillars of object oriented programming? Give a single-sentence description of each.*

• Abstraction - focuses on the high-level and abstract way the low-level details
• Encapsulation - keeps state private so that a various number of states and modules, e.g. relation to data and logic, can be enforced
• Inheritance - reusing code and not using hierarchies
• Polymorphism - being able to design for a synamic runtime behaviour with easier extensibility and substituability

#### *What is the strategy pattern? How would its implementation differ between a functional and object oriented system?*

Strategy pattern is the ability to define a family of algorithms and put each into a seperate class whilst making their objects interchangeable.

FP is based on the principles of immutability, transparency and higher-order functions as well as recursion. OOP is based on the principles of inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation and abstraction.

#### *Imagine your is creating a new online payment system. In order to gain maximum market share it can't be tied to a particular sector - it needs to work just as well when ordering a takeaway as when buying a new coat. Which design methodology would you suggest following? Give some justification for your decision.*
