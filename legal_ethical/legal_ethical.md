## TASK

### Scenario 1

####*Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?*

Assuming that BankingCorp is within the EU, they should adhere with GDPR. This would mean that the personal data they possess will be processed through law as well as fairly. When working with a loan company, especially given that they are sharing personal data, consent from customers should highly be required. In addition, the payday loan company was stated to have had some negative publicity which would mean that customers may have not preferred that company to be handling their data; BankingCorp choosing to not disclose this with their customers presents lack of transparency, which would contradict the GDPR.



####*What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?*



####*What could the company do to address these issues?*
