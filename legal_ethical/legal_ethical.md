## TASK

### Scenario 1

#### *Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?*

Assuming that BankingCorp is within the EU, they should adhere to GDPR. This would mean that the personal data they possess will be processed through law as well as fairly. When working with a loan company, especially given that they are sharing personal data, consent from customers should highly be required. In addition, the payday loan company was stated to have had some negative publicity which would mean that customers may have not preferred that company to be handling their data; BankingCorp choosing to not disclose this with their customers presents lack of transparency, which would contradict the GDPR.



#### *What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?*

An ethical concern that would be raised is breach of trust. When BankingCorp made the decision to not announce the collaboration with the loan company, they had damaged the trust the customers had when choosing this bank. When customers pick a bank, it is often based on trust that the bank will act in their best interest. Following this, the customers should be fully aware of how their data is being shared or used, so they can choose to agree or disagree with the methods BankingCorp are taking. Some customers may disfavour loan companies due to the interest rates, let alone a payday loan company that has recently made a bad reputation of itself.

#### *What could the company do to address these issues?*

BankingCorp could explicitly inform them of the new collaboration offering cutomers to give their full consent through a cmmunication platform, e.g. email, phone call, letter. Using the accept cookies, they could target specific customers they believe may benefit from a loan and specifically ask for their consent. If they wanted a broader audience and not have specific targets based on their financial data, offering generally to their whole customer base may be advantageous. 

When working with external companies, specifically loan companies, they should ensure they have a good reputation and background. Studying the loan company and ensuring that they are well suited may assist with their own reputation and increase customer trust. Exploring more loan companies that would better the services and benefit customers with financial struggles.
