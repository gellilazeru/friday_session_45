## TASK

### Scenario 1

#### *Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?*

Assuming that BankingCorp is within the EU, they should adhere to GDPR. This would mean that the personal data they possess will be processed through law as well as fairly. When working with a loan company, especially given that they are sharing personal data, consent from customers should highly be required. In addition, the payday loan company was stated to have had some negative publicity which would mean that customers may have not preferred that company to be handling their data; BankingCorp choosing to not disclose this with their customers presents lack of transparency, which would contradict the GDPR.


#### *What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?*

An ethical concern that would be raised is breach of trust. When BankingCorp made the decision to not announce the collaboration with the loan company, they had damaged the trust the customers had when choosing this bank. When customers pick a bank, it is often based on trust that the bank will act in their best interest. Following this, the customers should be fully aware of how their data is being shared or used, so they can choose to agree or disagree with the methods BankingCorp are taking. Some customers may disfavour loan companies due to the interest rates, let alone a payday loan company that has recently made a bad reputation of itself.

#### *What could the company do to address these issues?*

BankingCorp could explicitly inform them of the new collaboration offering cutomers to give their full consent through a cmmunication platform, e.g. email, phone call, letter. Using the accept cookies, they could target specific customers they believe may benefit from a loan and specifically ask for their consent. If they wanted a broader audience and not have specific targets based on their financial data, offering generally to their whole customer base may be advantageous. 

When working with external companies, specifically loan companies, they should ensure they have a good reputation and background. Studying the loan company and ensuring that they are well suited may assist with their own reputation and increase customer trust. Exploring more loan companies that would better the services and benefit customers with financial struggles.

### Scenario 2

#### *Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?*

Similar to the previous scenario, the game must comply with GDPR. In terms of handling data fairly and ensuring that all new updates are disclosed to users. Ensuring that there is parental control when sharing benefits so that minors are not misled and hold the responsibility. In saying that, gambling may be a concern as real-money purchases are incorporated.


#### *What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?*

Introducing microtransactions, especially aiding in solving puzzles, can lead to an unfair disadvatage; players who spend more money would have the upper hand on those who wish to not spend money on the game. Additionally, a game that is accessible to minors may raise a concern regarding the exlpoitation who are yet to understad the implications of purchases within the game. When introducing money to an app it may encourage gambling and, in addition to that, addiction; having the game designed to encourage spendings can permit addictive behaviour which may be a concern. Similar to the previous scenario, there should always be a high level of transparency when introducing new uopdates, especially in regards to money spending.

#### *What could the company do to address these issues?*

Communicating options to all players, including the benefits of in game purchases as well as the disadvantages; this will help in building trust and allow for players to make a well thought of decision. Incorporating age restrictions and allowign for explicit parental control may mean that minors will not be making the in game purchases themselves. Lastly, incorporating customer feedback and having a fair balance when charging certain prices will give off a safe relationship between the game owners and users, which would contribute to the trust as well as having a safe line between what is too much to spend.

### Scenario 3

#### *Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?*

Sharing user location for specific target audience must comply with the GDPR (if in EU). Users should fulyy permit to having their data being shared to encourage fairness factor. When advertising premium subscriptions, there should be no harmful products being advertised.

#### *What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?*

Some concerns may involve sharing user's location data that may be used for wrong reasons, which may make users feel vulnerable, especially in times where they are unaware of when their locations are being utilised. Introducing premieum qualities that may threaten their safety if they do not convert their account may put them in an uncomfortable position

#### *What could the company do to address these issues?*

They should respect the user's privacy, and ensure that when asking for consent, it is fully explicit and clear to them. Being transparent in what they use their data for is key in gaining trust from users, and will encourage them to use this website more and freely. Ensure that the prices that the premium subscription is set reasonably so that it can be accessible by a lot of cutomers, which will increase customer base. Ensure that the advertisements is reasonable and relevant to the aim of the users. Ensure that all information is transparent and informed in as much detail as possible.
